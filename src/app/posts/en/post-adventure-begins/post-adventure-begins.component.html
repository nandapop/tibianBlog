If you have never heard about Tibia, is a MMORPG developed in 1997 by a group of students from Regensburg, Germany, thanks to the success of the game they were able to build a company around it name <a href="http://www.cipsoft.com/" target="_blank">CipSoft</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> in the year 2001, you can read about their history from this extract of the official website:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">CipSoft GmbH was founded in June 2001 by Guido LÃ¼bke, Stephan Payer, Ulrich Schlott and Stephan Vogler. However, the development of Tibia, our first product, started much earlier. In fact, it was developed as a hobby project at a time when we still operated under the name of CIP Productions. Nevertheless, thanks to a thoughtful, gradual development, a large fan community and to our experience of many years we managed to work profitably from the start.


The idea to create an online role playing game was born in the autumn of 1995. In contrast to text-based multi user dungeons, which were common in those days, Tibia was to have a graphical user interface which would give players a better idea of the world in which they live.

On January 1997, we were ready to launch a permanent public server. The game has been continually improved ever since and the number of players has never ceased growing, owing, among other things, to the support it received by its many different fansites.
In 2001, Premium Accounts were introduced, which quickly turned into the company's main source of earnings. Thanks to sustainable growth, Tibia is until today one of the largest online role playing games in Europe.

Being a free to play game with low graphical requirements and optimized to be played with a slow connection, Tibia became very successful in developing countries, especially from South America, with many players coming from countries like Brazil and Venezuela, despite the fact that it is a European game.

Were this same facts that attract me to play Tibia, it was my first online role playing game and one of the things that I found interesting was the fact that in the virtual World of tibia one could be playing with people from all over the World, making friend and socializing. But some of the same success of the game was also a problem for Cip, due to the sudden appearance of alternative markets to trade in game gold/goods or even characters, this brought a lot of cheaters and botters (grinding online 24x7). Also some organized groups started to power abuse in the game charging other players to access certain areas and threatening anyone who wouldn't like to obey and play by their rules.

<p>
For this reason, some players started to leave the game leaving some Worlds almost completely deserted, this was true until last year when Cip implemented many improvements to their game client which made the game a lot more atractive for new and old players alike. Some of the biggest improvements was the incorporation of battleye which solved the bots and cheaters problem, that was one of the reasons that compelled me to come back to the game and take the challenge of getting premmium time only with game only currency. It is because this challenge that I can enjoy some of the content of free Zones that otherwise I wouldn't visit and that were part of my first years playing Tibia, like for example <a href="http://tibia.wikia.com/wiki/Kazordoon" target="_blank">Kazordoon</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>, <a href="http://tibia.wikia.com/wiki/Thais_Dragon_Lair" target="_blank">Thais Dragons</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> or <a href="http://tibia.wikia.com/wiki/Plains_of_Havoc" target="_blank"> Plains of Havoc.</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
